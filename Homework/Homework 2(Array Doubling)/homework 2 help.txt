homework 2: 

dynamically allocate memory - pointers
**make sure free memory to allocate doubling *****
test with smaller set to verify 

using array for other parts of the code -- reading words from hunger games and keeping track of them

array doubling: 

write vector class to implement (dynamically allocated array) (not actually a class called vector) 

copy values over into new array just created (which is double in size, found in memory, need to free up old memory) 
keep doubling, (use loop to do work of copying) 


passing vector by reference - (&) 

freeing up space- delete[]mylist; (mylist = array name)

stop words-vector (throw it out if stop word, not stop word-go through list of words if seen before add to count, havent seen before, add to end of array)
word count-array


muliple command line - ./a.out 
(make sure order is correct-- make sure arg[v] for number is converted: atoi(cstring, stoi(string
