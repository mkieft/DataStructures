Lab 4: Sorting Functions

Selection:
	find smallest element in unsorted portion of array; 
	swap it into its final position; 
	continue until all elements sorted;

	9, 4, 7, 2, 8, 3, 5
	2, 4, 7, 9, 8, 3, 5
	2, 3, 7, 9, 8, 4, 5
	2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 7, 5
	2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 7, 9
	2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

	after each run of the outer loop have partially sorted array after each run of sorting algorithm
	unsorted part will shrink by 1 
	by the end, the entire algorithm will be sorted
